'Do Artifacts Have Politics?' by Langdon Winner has to be a thouoght provoking paper I've read in a while. Winner begins with a simple question, 'Are technologies actually neutral, or can they be used to create gaps in society when deployed by people in power?' Personally, I never saw technology as a tool to create social and political distances. Obviously technology will shape the society, but could it be use willingly to have certain effects in a community? Langdon made me rethink! And yes, technology is not entirely neutral, especially when it's deployment is controlled by greedy and the powerfuls.
The paper exposes two distinct examples of misconduct of artifacts to have a willful long-term impact on society. And undoubtedly these changes favoured one side of people than the rest. The construction of low overpasses was actually briliant, but alas for all the wrong reasons! Robert Moses's parkways were constructed in such a way that won't allow buses to travel through them, essentailly keeping the lower class outside of his public park. To this day the long island political constitution is affected because of the 'marvelous' usage of structures. What puzzles me is that, why a single person was completely responsible to design the structures of an entire part of a city. Obviously he was genius, no doubts about that, but there should have been a like a city council which ultimately finalizes the design. No single person should have such authority because power tends to corrupt souls; even the good ones! 
The second illustration showcases what seems to be an advancemnet in technology disguised as a machinery of increased efficiency was actually used to crush the dying souls of labors. At Cyrus McCormick's reaper manufacturing plant, a new untested machine was introduced in the production line. On outside, it's an investment of $500,000 to upgrade the plant manfacturing unit and achieve faster and better castings. But the machine certifiably produced inferior products. Seems like a bad investment. But the machinery was introduced to intimidate the workers and dissolve any labor union. Bad investment? The incident took place in 1880s and today I think the labor union are more prominent and centralized. But honestly, who knows. The advancment in generative AI is the new industrialisation era, possibly far more revolutionzing and rapid.
The author also discusses about the tomato harvester and how it adversely changed the life of rural agriculture producers. The universit officials, who invented and modified the harvester, faced a law suit charging them that they are using government funding to develop technologies which benfits private companies. I'm personally in a gery area with this one. On one side the allegations make sense but on the other hand we need to develop our existing farming techniques in order to keep up with the growing populaiton. If not done so we risk starving people without enough farm produce. So starving people or richer companies, tough line to draw. 
Langner then proceeds to discsusing about authoritarian and democratic approach of handeling these technologies, specifically nuclear energy.
